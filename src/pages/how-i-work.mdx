# How I Work

My approach to design has evolved over the years, and at the moment I’m practicing a very relaxed version of continuous discovery + continuous design.

**Continuous discovery**, because I rely on internal and external feedback to think about new product features, and to validate my hypothesis.

**Continuous design**, because I understand that a good product is the result of a never-ending refinement process, and a Figma document is usually the start of a journey, not the end.

When solving problems with others, I have a strong bias towards action. I usually prefer showing a crude visual version of an idea to get a conversation started, rather than discuss abstract concepts, or show very polished visuals.

Don’t get me wrong, I *really* enjoy juggling complex UX/UI problems in my head, and thinking about information architecture, product strategy, and how all pieces of design work fit into a larger narrative. But at the end of the day, **shipped is better than perfect**.

I’m also a big fan of proper team work, and shared ownership: I absolutely do not care who gets the credit, as long as the journey is fun and the end result is good. I am used to working on mixed teams, where the barriers between business, design and development are blurry.

As a generalist, I’m happy to help move the proverbial needle using any of my skills: sometimes the project needs big, shiny work, and sometimes it just needs monotonous, repetitive work.

I have learned to have fun doing both.

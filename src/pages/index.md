# Hi, I’m Ale Muñoz!

I **love** design. I **love** code.

I solve product problems by any means necessary, including speaking with people and/or doing nothing (an underrated skill, if you ask me).

I also love orange, but can use other colors.

I've worked at the intersection of design and technology for as long as I can remember. I'm comfortable with all steps of the product process and can do 0 to 1 product development, but my true passion is designing things and bringing them to life.

You can read more about [how I work](/how-i-work) or [check some of my recent projects](/projects).

If you want to get in touch, you can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bomberstudios.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bomberstudios/).

      <h1>Hi, I‚Äôm Ale Mu√±oz!</h1>
      <p>
        I <strong>love</strong> design. I <strong>love</strong> code.
      </p>
      <p>I also love orange, but can use other colors.</p>

      <p>
        I've worked at the intersection of design and technology for as long as
        I can remember. I'm comfortable with all steps of the product process
        and can do 0 to 1 product development, but my true passion is designing
        things and bringing them to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a designer with many years of experience, I use both my skills and my
        <em>intuition</em> to create simple solutions to complex problems. I enjoy
        my craft and <a href="https://ale.today/polish-polish-polish"
          >love to work on the details</a
        >, but I always try to reach the sweet spot between ‚Äúthis is perfect‚Äù
        and ‚Äúwe need this yesterday‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p>This is a recent project that (I believe) illustrates these points.</p>

      <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>
      <h5>Client: Qatium, 2025</h5>
      <h5>Tools: Research, ideation, design and front end development.</h5>
      <p class="lead">
        I took a project from 0 to 1 in 4 days. I started with a vague
        definition of the problem and some raw materials and, collaborating with
        sales, clients and engineers, came up with a fully formed feature that
        our clients loved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project started with a surprise meeting on a random Wednesday. I
        got a ping from the sales team, asking me to join a call with a
        potential client the next day, and was given a couple of recordings of
        the client's previous meetings to get up to speed. I also had a PDF with
        formulas like this one:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <Image src={eeformulas} alt="Energy Efficiency Formulas" />
        <figcaption>
          Fun fact: the PDF used low resolution images for the formulas, so I
          used
          <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-79erpntCe-image-to-latex-converter"
            >ChatGPT</a
          > to translate the image of the formula to LaTeX, which I then pasted into
          an <a href="https://latexeditor.lagrida.com">online LaTeX editor</a> to
          get a high resolution version of it that I could screenshot for this website.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I spent the rest of the day watching recordings, reading transcripts and
        the PDF, and having an express meeting with one of our hydraulic
        engineers, who explained the formulas to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, I joined the call with the client, got some very good
        ideas from listening to them, and by the end of the day I had a rough
        sketch of the plugin we were going to build:
      </p>
      <Image class="border" src={eesketches} alt="Energy Efficiency Sketches" />
      <p>
        Calculating the energy efficiency of a network in terms our customers
        want to see (money, basically) is not trivial for multiple reasons.
        Instead, I came up with an idea to calculate a unit-less energy
        efficiency score for their water networks, similar to what you see in
        sport watches. This would allow our customers to compare their networks
        with each other, and with other networks in the app, to hopefully
        motivate them to improve their score.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="text">
      <p>
        Once I validated the idea with our hydraulic engineer and our sales
        team, I started working on a static mockup of the feature on Figma:
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="image">
      <Image src={eemockup} alt="Energy Efficiency Mockup" />
    </section>

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        Simultaneously, I worked on a rough algorithm to calculate the Energy
        Efficiency Score, using <a href="https://developer.qatium.app"
          >our platform's SDK</a
        >. It also rendered the energy efficiency for pipes on the map, using a
        color scale:
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="image">
      <Image src={eealgo} alt="Energy Efficiency Algorithm" />
    </section>

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        Once I was reasonably sure that our clients would find the feature
        useful, I started working on the front end. <a
          href="https://qatium.github.io/app/components/">Our design system</a
        > already had many of the components I needed, but I had to create a new
        one: the radial progress bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that, I used TypeScript, React and SVG, and wrote an isolated
        component in Storybook that we could use in other parts of the app. I
        also had to add a new layout component, <a
          href="https://qatium.github.io/app/components/?path=/docs/components-zstack--documentation"
          >ZStack</a
        >, to take care of the special needs for this component.
      </p>

    <section class="image">
      <Image src={eecode} alt="Energy Efficiency Code" />
    </section>
    <section class="text">
      <p>I also added some animations to make the score change more fun:</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image">
      <EnergyScore initialScore={42} client:only="react" />
      <p>Click the widget to randomize the value.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        The feature was a success, and we got a lot of positive feedback from
        our clients. I also learned a lot about energy efficiency, and how to
        calculate it for water networks. I'm very proud of this project, and
        happy to have been part of it.

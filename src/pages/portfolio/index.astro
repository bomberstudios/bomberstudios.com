      <h1>Hi, I’m Ale Muñoz!</h1>
      <p>
        I <strong>love</strong> design. I <strong>love</strong> code.
      </p>
      <p>I also love orange, but can use other colors.</p>

      <p>
        I've worked at the intersection of design and technology for as long as
        I can remember. I'm comfortable with all steps of the product process
        and can do 0 to 1 product development, but my true passion is designing
        things and bringing them to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a designer with many years of experience, I use both my skills and my
        <em>intuition</em> to create simple solutions to complex problems. I enjoy
        my craft and <a href="https://ale.today/polish-polish-polish"
          >love to work on the details</a
        >, but I always try to reach the sweet spot between “this is perfect”
        and “we need this yesterday”.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are some recent projects that (I believe) illustrate these points.

        I took a project from 0 to 1 in 4 days. I started with a vague
        definition of the problem and some raw materials and, collaborating with
        sales, clients and engineers, came up with a fully formed feature that
        our clients loved.

        I improved the UX for a feature using as little time as possible, going
        straight to code once a design decision was made.

## What is this?

Every now and then, the music industry decides to revisit some of its more iconic records, and breathe new life into them.

In a similar spirit, I decided to revisit one of my old projects, and see how it would ‚Äúsound‚Äù a few years later: revisit decisions made and solutions applied (if needed), and rebuild parts of it with new tooling and workflows.

I thought it would be an interesting experiment, to evaluate how far we've come as a profession (and what, if anything, we've missed in the way here).

I was not disappointed.

## The original project

My chosen project is one I'm particularly fond of: the complete redesign of [Bankinter](https://bankinter.com), one of the largest banks in Spain (back in the day, at least).

It was a huge project, with a lot of moving parts, and a lot of people involved. I was the lead designer, and I worked with a team of three designers (UX, Business and Service Design), a UX researcher, and a project manager / strategic designer. We worked on the strategy, the design, and part of the implementation of the new design.

It was also the last big design project I worked on before joining Sketch, and the things I learnt about systemic design in complex scenarios helped shape many of its features, including the Symbols system in Sketch 3.0.

On the soft-skills side, it required a great deal of communication with multiple stakeholders, with multiple workshops and presentations to get everyone on board with the new strategy and design.

Also, their branding is **orange**. That's *always* a plus.

## Tooling

Bankinter was the first enterprise project where I started using Sketch alongside our official design tool, Adobe Fireworks. We also added a bit of Adobe Illustrator and Microsoft PowerPoint, and even some HTML for clickable prototypes.

Collaborating with a team back in the day was a *nightmare*. An infinite game of ping pong via email and shared file servers, with no version control. Hundreds of files named `YYYYMMDD-project-name-editor-name.extension`, and a consolidation step at the end of every day to merge all the changes into a single file.

<Img src="projects/bankinter/files.png" alt="Original Bankinter project" />

A nasty side effect of using Fireworks (and the main motivation behind this remastered project, really) is that all the exports from the project are low resolution bitmaps:

<ImageZoom src="projects/bankinter/crunchy-pixels.png" alt="Original Bankinter project" />

I'm old school, and love the texture of fist-sized pixels and the sharpness of a good pixel-perfect line. But I have to admit these don't live up to modern standards.

So I spent some time redrawing some of those screens, translating the text, and polishing the layout and spacing. I even updated the dates on the screens to 2025!

While I was at it, I created styles and components in Figma.

## Design foundations

I'm glad to confirm that **the basics are the basics for a good reason**, and most of the big decisions made back in the day have stood the test of time: the grid, spacing, and font scales still work like the first day.

Something we're missing in 2025 is how easy it was to work with **noise textures** in fills. Figma has *nothing* like that (at least natively), and Sketch's implementation is (still) a bit of a hack. Fireworks' noise feature was excellent (it was truly random), and I miss it dearly. I removed the noise in most fills, and while it's not a huge change, it takes away some of the character of the design.

## The new project

The new project is still a work in progress. The plan is to transition all the original screens to Figma, including the clickable prototypes that we originally created using HTML and CSS.

While I've tried to keep the design as close to the original as possible, I am definitely taking advantage of the new tools and techniques available. Symbols in Fireworks were a bit of a hassle to work with, and modern tools make it a lot easier to create _and maintain_ reusable components.

I'm also using Figma's **Autolayout** feature to create a more flexible design system, keeping the design as modular as possible. I'm not a huge fan of the feature, but I have to admit it makes some things easier. I still prefer to use it as a last resort, and only when I really need it.

> For a quite critical take on Autolayout and other Figma features, check out [this article](https://uxdesign.cc/figmas-not-a-design-tool-it-s-a-rube-goldberg-machine-for-avoiding-code-2a24f11add5d). While I don't necessarily agree with all the points made, as a designer who codes I definitely sympathize with the general idea that sometimes we forget that Figma is a means to an end, not the end itself. I riff a bit about that in my [How I Work](/how-i-work/) page.

## Conclusions

- Thankfully, **design systems** are a thing now. We struggled with this back in the day, and I'm glad to see that the industry is finally catching up with the idea of creating reusable components and styles. Things are still not as explicit as they could be (specially when comparing to code), but working on complex projects is no longer a nightmare.

- **Collaboration tools** have improved dramatically, making it easier to manage projects with multiple designers (or one designer and multiple devices). I can't imagine going back to the old way of working.

- I love that I can now export my work in a **vector format**. When I need to revisit this project in 2035 for ultra-high resolution screens, I won't have to redraw everything from scratch üéâ. I'd love to have an open format in all modern design tools, but I can settle for exporting to SVG or PDF.

- **Autolayout** is still not worth it 90% of the time. I find myself actively fighting against it most of the time, and I can't stop thinking it would be easier to use HTML + SVG / PDF files

- For something a bit more personal, [this post on my blog](https://ale.today/thinking-about-design-tooling-again/) has some of my thoughts about design tooling.

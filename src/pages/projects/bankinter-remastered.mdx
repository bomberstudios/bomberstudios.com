## What is this?

Every now and then, the music industry decides to revisit some of its more iconic records, and breathe new life into them.

In a similar spirit, I decided to revisit one of my old projects, and see how it would ‚Äúsound‚Äù a few years later: revisit decisions made and solutions applied (if needed), and rebuild parts of it with new tooling and workflows.

I thought it would be an interesting experiment, to evaluate how far we‚Äôve come as a profession (and what, if anything, we‚Äôve missed in the way here).

I was not disappointed.

## The original project

My chosen project is one I‚Äôm particularly fond of: the complete redesign of [Bankinter](https://bankinter.com), one of the largest banks in Spain (back in the day, at least).

It was the last big design project I worked on before joining Sketch, and the things I learnt about systemic design in complex scenarios helped shape the Symbols system in Sketch 3.0.

On the soft-skills side, it required a great deal of communication with multiple stakeholders, with multiple workshops and presentations to get everyone on board with the new strategy and design.

Also, their branding is **orange**. That‚Äôs *always* a plus.

> Fun fact: believe it or not, bankers will check the numbers in your mockups and complain when they don‚Äôt add up. In this project, I learnt to design with a calculator by my side üòÖ

### Tooling

Bankinter was the first enterprise project where I started using Sketch alongside our official design tool, Adobe Fireworks. We also added a bit of Adobe Illustrator and Microsoft PowerPoint, and even some HTML for clickable prototypes.

Collaborating with a team back in the day was a *nightmare*. An infinite game of ping pong via email and shared file servers, with no version control. Hundreds of files named `YYYYMMDD-project-name-editor-name.extension`, and a consolidation step at the end of every day to merge all the changes into a single file.

A nasty side effect of using Fireworks (and the main motivation behind this remastered project, really) is that all the exports from the project are low resolution bitmaps:

I‚Äôm old school, and love the texture of fist-sized pixels and the sharpness of a good pixel-perfect line. But I have to admit these don‚Äôt live up to modern standards.

So I spent some time redrawing some of those screens, so I could get from this:

to this:

While I was at it, I also took the opportunity to translate the text, polish the layout and spacing, and create styles and components in Figma.

## Design foundations

I'm glad to confirm that **the basics are the basics for a good reason**, and most of the big decisions made back in the day have stood the test of time: the grid, spacing, and font scales still work like the first day.

Something we're missing in 2025 is how easy it was to work with **noise textures** in fills. Figma has *nothing* like that (at least natively), and Sketch's implementation is (still) a bit of a hack. Fireworks' noise feature was excellent (it was truly random), and I miss it dearly. I removed the noise in most fills, and while it's not a huge change, it takes away some of the character of the design.

## Conclusions

- **Design systems** are a thing now. We struggled with this back in the day, and I‚Äôm glad to see that the industry is finally catching up with the idea of creating reusable components and styles.

- **Collaboration tools** have improved dramatically, making it easier to manage projects with multiple designers. I can't imagine going back to the old way of working.

- I love that I can now export my work in a **vector format**. When I need to revisit this project in 2035 for ultra-high resolution screens, I won't have to redraw everything from scratch üéâ. I'd love to have an open format in all modern design tools, but I can settle for exporting to SVG or PDF.

- **Autolayout** is still not worth it 90% of the time. I find myself actively fighting against it most of the time, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking it would be easier to use HTML + SVG / PDF files

      ## Problem

      Create a feature that allows our clients to **calculate the energy efficiency of their water networks**, and compare them with other networks in the app.

      ## Context

      This project started with a surprise meeting on a random Wednesday. I
      got a ping from the sales team, asking me to join a call with a
      potential client the next day, and was given a couple of recordings of
      the client's previous meetings to get up to speed. I also had a PDF with
      formulas like this one:

      <figure>
        <Image src={eeformulas} alt="Energy Efficiency Formulas" />
        <figcaption>
          Fun fact: the PDF used low resolution images for the formulas, so I
          used
          <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-79erpntCe-image-to-latex-converter">ChatGPT</a>
          to translate the image of the formula to LaTeX, which I then pasted into
          an <a href="https://latexeditor.lagrida.com">online LaTeX editor</a> to
          get a high resolution version of it that I could screenshot for this website.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I spent the rest of the day watching recordings, reading transcripts and
        the PDF, and having an express meeting with one of our hydraulic
        engineers, who explained the formulas to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, I joined the call with the client, got some very good
        ideas from listening to them, and by the end of the day I had a rough
        sketch of the plugin we were going to build:

      ## Solution

      Calculating the actual energy efficiency of a network in terms our customers
      want to see (money, basically) is not trivial for multiple reasons.
      Instead, I came up with an idea to calculate a unit-less energy
      efficiency score for their water networks, similar to what you see in
      sport watches. This would allow our customers to compare their networks
      with each other, and with other networks in the app, to hopefully
      motivate them to improve their score.

      Once I validated the idea with our hydraulic engineer and our sales
      team, I started working on a static mockup of the feature on Figma:

    </section>

    <section class="text">
      Simultaneously, I worked on a rough algorithm to calculate the Energy
      Efficiency Score, using <a href="https://developer.qatium.app">our platform's SDK</a>. It also rendered the energy efficiency for pipes on the map, using a
      color scale:

    </section>

    <section class="text">
      Once I was reasonably sure that our clients would find the feature
      useful, I started working on the front end. <a href="https://qatium.github.io/app/components/">Our design system</a> already had many of the components I needed, but I had to create a new
      one: the radial progress bar.

      For that, I used TypeScript, React and SVG, and wrote an isolated
      component in Storybook that we could use in other parts of the app. I
      also had to add a new layout component, <a href="https://qatium.github.io/app/components/?path=/docs/components-zstack--documentation">ZStack</a>, to take care of the special needs for this component.

      I also added an animation to make the score change more fun:

      <EnergyScore initialScore={42} client:only="react" />
    </section>

      ## Results
      The feature was a success, and we got a lot of positive feedback from our clients. It went straight to production without requiring many iterations.
